This example demonstrates a common yet subtle error in JavaScript: the implicit type coercion leading to string concatenation when performing addition with a mix of number and string types.  The function `foo` intends to add two numbers, but because one of the arguments is a string, JavaScript converts the number to a string and concatenates them.  The solution shows how to use strict equality checks and explicit type conversions to avoid this.
